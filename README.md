# Job Tracker



This app allows you to fill in a text field with a company's name and a job position. 

This then adds the job posting to your Job Tracker

On the Job tracker page you can log your progress as you apply and go an offer to a position.

There's also a convenient sort option to sort jobs you've added by recent or oldest.

The following is what a populated tracker can look like.
